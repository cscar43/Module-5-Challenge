# Module-5-Challenge

Attached is the homework for the module 5 challenge as well as the csv files of where we got the information we used on the assignment.

I used chat gpt with two parts of the code:
  -helping me through the calculations i needed to get the quartiles for the tumor volumes and treatments. I asked for an example of how it works
  rather then using the exact questions and helping me through it until i had written a proper loop to get the end result.
  -I also used it to show me how to make a copy of the data frame i was using so that when i sorted it down for the line graph i had the original i
  could use for the scatterplot.
  
 Other then that i used what we learned and did in the activities from the last 3 classes on these subjects.
